# Swift Cross Compilation Toolchains

This project extends the work of [Johannes Weiss](https://github.com/weissi) and [Helge He√ü](https://github.com/AlwaysRightInstitute/swift-mac2arm-x-compile-toolchain) to create MacOS cross-compilers which target Ubuntu on amd64 and arm64, respectively. All real credit goes to them.

This version extends the previous work by:

1. incorporating Swift 5.3
2. creating a complete runtime library which can be used with Docker containers or natively to provide swift applications with precisely the libraries they were originally compiled with.

**_(Support for armv7 and armv6 platforms has been dropped due to being unable to compile the Swift toolchain for those platforms)_**

IMO, the point 2 above is the most important. This makes is possible to deploy "distro-less" docker containers of your swift applications which are extremely small. I am currently working on several R/Pi servers as examples which use this technique.

## Easy way to get started:

Just use the installers at: [github](https://github.com/CSCIX65G/SwiftCrossCompilers/releases). Then skip the hard way immediately below and proceed directly to: `Using your cross-compiler`

## Hard way - Build your own:

### Requirements

Homebrew coreutils, jq, and wget installed with:

```
brew install coreutils jq wget
```

### Building the toolchain on MacOS

To start, create the directory and fetch the code to do the build (it's just a complicated bash script):

```
git clone https://github.com/CSCIX65G/SwiftCrossCompilers.git
cd SwiftCrossCompilers
```

To build an _arm64_ cross compiler (for R/Pi 64-bit OSes):

```
./build_cross_compiler  Configurations/5.3.3-RELEASE/arm64.json
```

To build an _amd64_ cross compiler (for Ubuntu 18.04 running for example on cloud instances):

```
./build_cross_compiler  Configurations/5.3.3-RELEASE/amd64.json
```

Each call to the build script will take several minutes to complete. This is particularly true of the steps where it:

- fetches the toolchain
- fetches and parses the Ubuntu package files and
- builds the ld.gold linker

When it does finish, you should get a message saying all is well and that the following directories: Toolchains, SDKs, and Destinations, have been populated with various (arm64|armhf|amd64) files have been produced.

NB if you are building multiple x-compilers, you need to be very careful to clean things out under `./InstallPackagers/SwiftCrossCompiler/Developer` between builds.

The cross compilers end up under: `./InstallPackagers/SwiftCrossCompiler/Developer` by default. If you don't want to make installer packages, you can simply copy the Toolchains, SDKs, Runtime and Destinations directories from there to `/Library/Developer`. NB If you wish to change the installed location from `/Library/Developer` you will need to change the files under Destinations to match your new installed location. Changes required in the file should be obvious.

If you do want to build your own installer package, you can get (Packages.app)[<http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html>] for free and open `./InstallPackagers/SwiftCrossCompiler/SwiftCrossCompiler.pkgproj`. You'll want to adjust the version number SwiftCrossCompiler/Settings, then just use the Build/Build menu option. The output will appear at `InstallPackagers/SwiftCrossCompiler/build/SwiftCrossCompiler.pkg`. Just double click that to install.

## Using your cross compiler

Assuming you have installed the cross compilers in /Library you can do the following from this directory.

```
cd helloworld
swift build --destination /Library/Developer/Destinations/arm64-5.3.3-RELEASE.json
swift build --destination /Library/Developer/Destinations/amd64-5.3.3-RELEASE.json
```

If this finishes successfully you have an:

arm64 executable in `.build/aarch64-unknown-linux/debug/helloworld` amd64 executable in `.build/x86_64-unknown-linux/debug/helloworld`

The same techniques and commands as above may be used on any of your own code which compiles with the Swift Package Manager.

### Important information about Swift PM.

One key item to watch out for is that if you use `#if os(macos)` or `#if os(linux)` in your Package.swift file to, for example, fetch different dependencies which depend on the target x-compile architecture, you will not get the desired result. The swiftpm fetch operations are running on the Mac in the case of the cross-compiler where with native compilation they are running on the Pi. Since swift does not natively support cross-compilation (for non-Apple toolchains), you'll need to roll your own `#if` statements to properly fetch dependencies.

### Remote execution on a Raspberry Pi

Now type:

```
./build-arm64.sh
```

This will build the helloworld program and put it into a docker image called helloworld:arm64-latest. Transport that container to the Pi along with the script `run-arm64.sh` . That script will run and print "Successful launch!" at the console.

### Remote debugging on the Pi

Now for the more experimental stuff (I'm still debugging remote lldb):

On your mac type:

```
/Library/Developer/Toolchains/arm64-swift.xctoolchain/usr/bin/lldb .build/aarch64-unknown-linux/debug/helloworld
```

This will produce an lldb prompt. (NB, you must use the version of lldb that ships with the toolchain, not the Xcode default)

```
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/swift-runtime//usr/lib/swift/linux:/swift-runtime/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu:/swift-runtime/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu
platform connect  connect://[IP or FQDN of your R/Pi]:9293
```

The first command tells the lldb-server running on your Pi where to find the swift runtime libraries. The last command should produce output similar to:

```
  Platform: remote-linux
    Triple: aarch64-*-linux-gnu
OS Version: 4.14.95 (4.14.95-hypriotos-v8)
    Kernel: #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jan 31 15:56:11 UTC 2019
  Hostname: e16dev-dev
 Connected: yes
WorkingDir: /debug
```

The first time you launch lldb you may need to say: platform select remote-linux

Now say:

```
run
```

(I find that sometimes you need exit lldb and rerun the steps above to get the remote process to launch successfully).

Running takes a while especially on first launch, because it has to copy the `helloworld` file to the R/Pi, but you should eventually see something like:

```
Process 32 launched: '.build/aarch64-unknown-linux/debug/helloworld' (aarch64)
Hello, world!
Process 32 exited with status = 0 (0x00000000)
```

Congrats, you have built and remote debugged an arm64 executable on your Mac.
